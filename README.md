Truth Table Generator
=====================

This is a JavaScript program which will generate a truth tables for formulas of propositional logic.  You can enter multiple formulas separated by commas to include more than one formula in a single table (e.g. to test for entailment).  You can select which symbols to use for truth-values and connectives, the style of the table (full table, main connective only, plain text, or LaTeX output), and two-valued or different types of three-valued tables.

The output characters used for the various connectives can be changed by modifying the `htmlchar()`, `txtchar()`, and `latexchar()` functions at the beginning of `truthtable.js`.

A live version of the program is [here](http://mrieppel.net/prog/truthtable.html).
